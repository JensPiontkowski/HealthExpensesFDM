  abstract="In spite of numerous discussions and programs aimed at reducing public health care costs in Germany, the country has seen a massive increase in health care costs at an annual average rate of 7{\%} since 1972. When German policymakers decided to reform the health care system by passing legislative measures on 22 December 1999, one of the key elements was to oblige hospitals and health insurance providers to replace the existing retrospective and procedural reimbursement system with a new prospective and diagnostic system based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). German policymakers are hoping to accomplish two feats with the introduction of DRGs: firstly, to improve the profitability of the health care system, and secondly, to improve the quality of health care services because DRGs require documentation and coding, which leads to increased transparency and allows for an external comparison of rendered services (benchmarking), as well as for an analysis and assessment of how appropriate and how successful the rendered services were in each particular case. Although the intentions underlying the introduction of DRGs are unquestionable, it remains to be determined whether the introduction has negative effects as well, and to which extent these negative effects have shown up so far. Hence the purpose of our survey will be to provide an extensive and systematic overview of results from other countries, along with preliminary results from Germany. In order to judge the trade-off between the desired and negative effects in a DRG system, we will define the set of parameters that determine the incentives of health care agents in such a system before surveying the economic and medical literature in light of these parameters in Section 3 and summarizing the results in Section 4. In view of the literature analysed, we find that the introduction of DRGs hasstarted a tendency towards a reduction in costs and towards a focus on profitability. If the legislator takes the necessary actions to reduce possible negative effects like manipulation and upcoding, the introduction of G-DRGs will lead to an increase in economic effectiveness and efficiency, while bringing more transparency into the quality of medical services at the same time.",

Das Modell identifiziert hierbei klare strukturelle Unterschiede zwischen den Optionskrankenh{\"a}usern und den Nicht-DRG-H{\"a}usern. Je h{\"o}her die Kosten, die Bettengr{\"o}{\ss}enklasse, die Auslastung, die Anzahl der Fachabteilungen und je niedriger die Verweildauer, desto wahrscheinlicher ist die Optionsentscheidung zum fr{\"u}hzeitigen Einstieg in das DRG-System. Diese quantitativen Ergebnisse werden abgeglichen mit Umfragen, die von Kliniken qualitative Gr{\"u}nde hinsichtlich der Optionsentscheidung abgefragt haben. Aus der Synthese quantitativer und qualitativer Informationen l{\"a}sst sich ableiten, dass die Strukturdaten eine notwendige Bedingung f{\"u}r den DRG-Start darstellen, w{\"a}hrend qualitativ genannte Motive wie „Training im Echtzeitbetrieb`` oder „m{\"o}gliche Wettbewerbsvorteile`` einen hinreichenden Beweggrund widerspiegeln und lediglich auf strukturellen Voraussetzungen basierende Gr{\"u}nde sind. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird argumentiert, dass durch die mit der optionalen Einf{\"u}hrung einhergehenden gesetzlichen {\"U}bergangsregelungen bei den Minder- und Mehrerl{\"o}saugleichen dazu f{\"u}hren k{\"o}nnten, dass ein Verteilungskampf um das festgeschriebene Budget entsteht.

  year = {2016},
  abstract= "State-space models (SSMs) are increasingly used in ecology to model time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible. They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.",

 abstract = {Most time series methods assume that any trend will continue unabated, regardless of the forecast leadtime. But recent empirical findings suggest that forecast accuracy can be improved by either damping or ignoring altogether trends which have a low probability of persistence. This paper develops an exponential smoothing model designed to damp erratic trends. The model is tested using the sample of 1,001 time series first analyzed by Makridakis et al. Compared to smoothing models based on a linear trend, the model improves forecast accuracy, particularly at long leadtimes. The model also compares favorably to sophisticated time series models noted for good long-range performance, such as those of Lewandowski and Parzen.},

 abstract = {The Holt-Winters forecasting procedure is a variant of exponential smoothing which is simple, yet generally works well in practice, and is particularly suitable for producing short-term forecasts for sales or demand time-series data. Some practical problems in implementing the method are discussed, including the normalization of seasonal indices, the choice of starting values and the choice of smoothing parameters. There is an important distinction between an automatic and a non-automatic approach to forecasting and detailed suggestions are made for implementing Holt-Winters in both ways. The question as to what underlying model, if any, is assumed by the method is also addressed. Some possible areas for future research are then outlined.},
